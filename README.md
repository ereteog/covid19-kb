# covid-19-search

An API made to index / search  and analyse Coronavirus related papers.
The papers are published by this [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)

## Requirement
You need to download papers from Kaggle challenge page.

This project uses Elasticsearch 7, you can use the docker container using the docker-compose file in `containers`:
```
docker-compose -f containers/docker-compose.yml up
```

## Usage

Properly set Elasticsearch configuration in `resources/config.edn`.

a command is available to load papers
```
lein run -m covid-19-search.import --paper-dir resources/CORD-19-research-challenge
```

launch the API
``` 
lein ring server
```

      "abstract": "Since 2010, a new variant of PEDV belonging to Genogroup 2 has been transmitting in China and further spreading to the Unites States and other Asian countries including Taiwan. In order to characterize in detail the temporal and geographic relationships among PEDV strains, the present study systematically evaluated the evolutionary patterns and phylogenetic resolution in each gene of the whole PEDV genome in order to determine which regions provided the maximal interpretative power. The result was further applied to identify the origin of PEDV that caused the 2014 epidemic in Taiwan. Thirty-four full genome sequences were downloaded from GenBank and divided into three non-mutually exclusive groups, namely, worldwide, Genogroup 2 and China, to cover different ranges of secular and spatial trends. Each dataset was then divided into different alignments by different genes for likelihood mapping and phylogenetic analysis. Our study suggested that both nsp3 and S genes contained the highest phylogenetic signal with substitution rate and phylogenetic topology similar to those obtained from the complete genome. Furthermore, the proportion of nodes with high posterior support (posterior probability N 0.8) was similar between nsp3 and S genes. The nsp3 gene sequences from three clinical samples of swine with PEDV infections were aligned with other strains available from GenBank and the results suggested that the virus responsible for the 2014 PEDV outbreak in Taiwan clustered together with Clade I from the US within Genogroup 2. In conclusion, the current study identified the nsp3 gene as an alternative marker for a rapid and unequivocal classification of the circulating PEDV strains which provides complementary information to the S gene in identifying the emergence of epidemic strain resulting from recombination.",

      "abstract": "Using an established nonhuman primate model for H5N1 highly pathogenic influenza virus infection in humans, we have been able to demonstrate the prophylactic mitigation of the pulmonary damage characteristic of human fatal cases from primary influenza virus pneumonia with a low dose oral formulation of a commercially available parenteral natural human interferon alpha (Alferon N Injection Ã’ ). At the highest oral dose (62.5 IU/kg body weight) used there was a marked reduction in the alveolar inflammatory response with minor evidence of alveolar and interstitial edema in contrast to the hemorrhage and inflammatory response observed in the alveoli of control animals. The mitigation of severe damage to the lower pulmonary airway was observed without a parallel reduction in viral titers. Clinical trial data will be necessary to establish its prophylactic human efficacy for highly pathogenic influenza viruses.\nAbbreviations: HPAI-, highly pathogenic avian influenza; LPAI-, low pathogenic avian influenza; HPIVh, highly pathogenic influenza virus in humans; TLR, toll-like receptor; LDO, low dose oral; IFN, interferon.",

3 paper formats are available: `abstract` (default), `full-text`, `raw-doc`.


### Get paper from id
Having a paper id you can directly retrieve it, with the desired format:
```
GET /covid-19/136eb8ca0c1420b21582827d1aaf78a8cd7082f4?format=raw-doc
```

### Related terms
This API proposes to retrieve terms than are highly correlated with a given query
